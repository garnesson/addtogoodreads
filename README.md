# Add to Goodreads

A simple Google Chrome extension that extracts a valid ISBN number from the current tab
and loads the "Add to my books" (http://www.goodreads.com/api/atmb_widget) widget. This hack
allows a user to easily add a book to one of the default shelves without requiring any special authentication (other than being logged in to the site).

See Chrome store entry:
